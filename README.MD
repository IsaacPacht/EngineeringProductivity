This is a 3D simulation of a software engineer.  A software engineer is a machine that converts caffeine into code.

The software engineer is represented by the weird double-funnel thingy in the center of the screen.  At the left side is the primary caffeine uptake port.  At the right is the code ejector.

As illustrated in the similation, the rate of caffeine intake is directly proportional to the rate of code produced.  In contrast, the rate of caffeine intake is inversely proportional to the number of bugs produced.

Tested on Chrome 77.
