This is a 3D simulation of a software engineer.  A software engineer is a machine that converts caffeine into code.

The software engineer is represented by the weird double-funnel thingy in the center of the screen.  At the left side is the primary caffeine uptake port.  At the right is the code ejector.

As illustrated in the similation, the rate of caffeine intake is directly proportional to the rate of code produced.  In contrast, the rate of caffeine intake is inversely proportional to the number of bugs produced.  

The up and down arrow buttons can be used to change the rate of caffeine intake.  The maximum allowed rate is 100 mg/hour.  A rate higher than this can cause your software engineer to malfunction.

Tested on Chrome 77.

(If you are too lazy to load this into your own browser, check out the demo video.  Although, for some reason it is very jerky.  The actual simulation runs much more smoothly.)
